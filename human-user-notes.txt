# starting prompt with claude code (putting in text since it got lost mid-write)

you are an experienced bevy and Rust game developer. today we are tasked with building a formula 1 telemetry data analyzer. it is heavily inspired by the [f1-race-replay](https://github.com/IAmTomShaw/f1-race-replay) project from the python community--note: this project makes use of the [fastf1](https://docs.fastf1.dev/index.html) project to get access to public formula 1 data. the data which it provides are for a given year and circuit, the qualifying and race lap data. each driver is available, and their x,y,z coordinates, the time of the sample, throttle % (1-100), brake % (0 or 100), gear number, speed (km/hr), and DRS status (on or off). 


we want to first recreate this application's replay and comparison features in rust and bevy. be mindful of the design and to effectively use the ECS component architecture expected in bevy. 

additional features we will add include: ability to create a turn area, which will be used to box in samples for turn analysis. Turn analysis will be further broken down into thirds: approach, apex, and exit. By default, one a turn's bounding boxes are established, we will go through all the laps x,y,z coordinates to filter only the samples that are relevant for that part of the lap. by default, we will sort ASC (fastest time in turn) on the whole lap area... but the user will be given the option to look into the subsegments (approach, apex, and entry) if different laps provide better time in each section (no need to offer sorting by subsection if the fastest turn was also the fastest in each subsection--it is redundant). That is the essence of our application's use case and how the driver / their team would use it to gain valuable insights on how to improve performance.


for your first task, suggest how to organize this project into a rust workspace (or if some other structure exists, please suggest it). my thinking is to have separate crates for the GUI that the users will interact with (bevy), one for the fastf1 data wrapper, and one for the telemetry analysis. Help me sort through this project. Be pragmatic and do not over-engineer for the sake of over-engineering. 


# continuing after structuring the project and agent orchestration

Great work. I think this will be helpful structure for future agents. Now let's return to the next steps you mentioned:

* Fetch some real data: cd tools && pip install -r requirements.txt && python fetch_session.py --year 2024 --circuit Monaco --session Q
* Implement track/car visualization in the replay plugin
* Build the turn bounding box creation UI
* Wire up the analysis display

I think we want to load in data from the US GP in Austin Texas from 2025. Let's do both Qualifiying and race data, for all drivers in the 2025 weekend. 

Additionally, let's use `uv` to run the python app, rather than venv and pip. This is the preferred usage for our team. Go ahead and updaate the python instructions accordingly to referenece uv instead of python or pip...
